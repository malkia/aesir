# aesir
After Effects Self Initiated Research :)

Actually was looking for cool name having AE in the name, and Aesir
came up:

The Æsir /ˈaɪsɪər/ are the gods of the principal pantheon in Norse religion.
They include Odin, Frigg, Hother, Thor, Baldr and Týr.

The second Norse pantheon is the Vanir. In Norse mythology, the two pantheons
wage war against each other, resulting in a unified pantheon.

Maybe the individual plugins ought to be named like this too:

aesir_odin,
aesir_frigg,
aesir_hother,
aesir_baldr, // This must be something beautiful I gather (from reading Neil Gaiman's book on Vikings)
aesir_tyr,
